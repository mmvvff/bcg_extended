# Data Science Job Simulation Project: Extended

## Overview
This project is based on a job simulation from Forage, focusing on a comprehensive Data Science workflow. It covers problem framing, hypothesis formulation, data pre-processing, model training and evaluation, and presenting findings to a non-technical audience. The project extends beyond the initial simulation requirements by incorporating Extended Data Pre-processing Techniques and conducting AB Testing of Pre-processing Approaches to evaluate their impact on model performance.

## Extended Data Pre-processing: In progress...
This project goes beyond the initial job simulation requirements by exploring additional data pre-processing techniques. These may include:
- Advanced feature selection methods
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Noise reduction strategies

## AB Testing: In progress...
We conduct an AB test to evaluate the impact of different data pre-processing approaches on model performance. This involves:
1. Defining two distinct pre-processing pipelines (A and B)
2. Applying each pipeline to the dataset
3. Training and evaluating models using both processed datasets
4. Comparing performance metrics to determine which approach yields better results
